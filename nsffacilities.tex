\textbf{Iowa State University}

Project components completed in the Hufford Laboratory will include mapping population development, DNA isolation and PCR, and population genetic analysis of genotyping data. Population development will be carried out in field space available at the Curtiss Farm of Iowa State University (ISU).  This facility is equipped with irrigation, tractors, tillage equipment, planters, and combines.  Seed processing and cold storage facilities are also available on the ISU campus.  The Hufford Laboratory has all equipment necessary for DNA isolation and PCR including centrifuges, thermal cyclers, an ultra-low freezer, water baths, a pH meter, balances, and an electrophoresis system. A gel imaging system and a NanoDrop spectrophotometer for DNA quantification are accessible through the Center for Plant Responses to Environmental Stresses at ISU. The DNA Facility at ISU provides access to cutting-edge genomic technology including HiSeq and MiSeq Illumina sequencing and library preparation for both paired-end and mate-pair approaches.  Data analyses will be carried out using the High Performance Computing clusters available at ISU. Dr. Hufford currently has access to the Lightning3 cluster which has a mix of Opteron based servers, consisting of 18 SuperMicro servers with core counts ranging from 32 to 64 and 256 to 512 GB of memory.

\textbf{UC Davis}

Dr. Ross-Ibarra has four standard laboratory benches as part of a shared lab space at UCD.  The shared space is the single largest lab space on campus, and provides for seamless interaction between the labs housed there.  The space currently houses three other PIs, all working on the genetics and genomics of economically important plant taxa (Dubcovsky, Neale, Dandekar). The lab is equipped with standard equipment and tools for molecular biology, including freezers and refrigeration, a shared liquid handling robot, thermal cyclers, centrifuges, gel rigs, balances, and standard molecular biology supplies.  A dedicated low-humidity refrigerator for seed storage is available through the university, and low-humidity storage cabinets for tissues and temporary seed storage are in the laboratory. Dr. Ross-Ibarra occupies half of a large office suite that includes a conference room and cubicle space for 25 people.  Both Macintosh and PC workstations are available for student and postdoc employees. The PI is a contributing partner in a large computer cluster, giving the lab dedicated access to 192 processors, with the opportunity for use of nearly 800 additional CPU as resources allow. Recent (2013) additions to the cluster have provided it with additional CPU as well as six new shared high-memory (512Gb RAM) nodes, one of which is dedicated to the Ross-Ibarra lab. Dr. Ross-Ibarra is a faculty member of the UC Davis Genome Center, a large facility that includes bioinformatics, genotyping, metabolomics, proteomics, and expression analysis cores able to perform a variety of genomics analyses at cost for UC Davis faculty. The Genome Center also rents time on its equipment, including a bioanlyzer and library preparation robots. As a member of the Genome Center, Dr. Ross-Ibarra also has access to their additional computational facilities. UC Davis has also entered into a recent partnership with BGI (formerly the Beijing Genomics Institute) to provide additional high-throughput sequencing services via a new Sacramento-based sequencing facility.

\textbf{LANGEBIO} 

Langebio's mandate is to conduct top-ranked research while promoting genomic knowledge for the protection and sustainable use of Mexican biodiversity. Its unique location in the agricultural center of Mexico facilitates field sampling and field experimentation. We have ample experience growing maize in nurseries located on the West Coast (Valle de Banderas, Nayarit), in Central Mexico (Irapuato; Celaya, Guanajuato), and have begun to establish additional sites in the high valleys of Central Mexico (Queretero; Estado de Mexico). We regularly conduct field expeditions to collect plants in both the dry regions of Northern Mexico (maize collections in Chihuahua, Lamiaceae throughout the Northeast) and the lower valleys of the Eje Volcanico and Costa del Pacifico (Teocintle and maize, Solanaceae, and Cucurbitaceae). Research at Langebio is supported by greenhouse facilities and two service units: Genomics and Mass Spectrometry, both of them equipped with state-of-the-art instrumentation, including several next-generation sequencing machines and diverse mass spectrometry equipments. Other facilities include a computation cluster and a specialized clean room for ancient DNA analysis.
